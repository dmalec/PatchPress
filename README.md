PatchPress
==========

PatchPress allows an Arduino sketch to talk to [Pachube](https://pachube.com/) and retrieve a data feed
at regular intervals.  It assumes the user has a Pachube account and an API key.

Requirements
------------
* An ethernet enabled Arduino or ethernet shield
* A Pachube account and API key

Recommended
-----------
* An [Internet of Things Printer](http://www.adafruit.com/products/717)
* An [RBG LCD Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/products/716)

PatchPress is heavily derived from [Adafruit's Gutenbird sample sketch](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Tweet-Receipt)
for the [Internet of Things Printer](http://www.adafruit.com/products/717).
